### Overview

The confluence of iso- and allo-cortex in the mesiotemporal lobe exhibits a profound cytoarchitectural gradient, and intersects with an anterior-posterior axis to harbour multiple dominant functional motifs within the parahippocampus-hippocampus complex. In the present project, we explored the cytoarchtiectural and functional correlates of the iso-to-allocortical and anterior-posterior axes of the mesiotemporal lobe. Here, we would like to share our scripts and maps to allow furher exploration of these axes. If you use the containing material please read and cite the following manuscript: <br />
